# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Create a website that will collect worldwide COVID-19 information from freely available data sources and renders the data in a clear and concise manner. 

# USER STORY Version 1.0
- When user enters the webpage, he/she will be presented with a landing page that will 
show some COVID-19 relevant image and text, together with a jumbotron of the projects name
- On the landing page, the user is presented wityh a drop-down list in the middle of the page
which lists all the countries for which COVID-19 data is available
- When the user selects a country, the page will switch to the COVID-19 details page for that country
- The drop-down list will move to the upper right portion of the page, under the project banner
- If there exists COVID-19 information for provinces/states within the selected country, a second drop down list with the provice/state list
- If the user selects a province, the country info will be replaced with the provincial information
- If there exists county/municipality information for the selected state/province, a third drop-down list will be presented to the right of the provincial/state drop-down list
- When the user selects a municipality/county, information for that area will replace the provincial/state information


# User Story, Version 2.0
- As an internet user, I'd like to be able to get COVID-19 information for the world as a whole.

- As an internet user, I'd like to be able to get COVID-19 information and statistics for individual countries and where possible drill down to provinces/states and counties/municipalities.

- As a user of the website that provides this information, I'd like to see synoptic statistics about the spread and impact of the COVID-19 virus.

- As a user of the website, while there, I'd like to see news headlines for the individual countries and localities as I view their statistics

- As a user, when I arrive to the website, I'd like to see the most recent 
statistics about COVID-19 for the entire world on the landing page of the site.

- As a user, I want to be able to drill down to specific countries for which COVID-19 statistics are available.

- If the country for which I want COVID-19 stats has information for lower administrative regions (states, provinces, municipalities, etc.), I want to be able to choose which one to see. This choice should be presented dynamically.
